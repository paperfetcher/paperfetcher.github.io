# Paperfetcher

Paperfetcher is a set of tools to automate time-intensive parts of the systematic review process. At v1.0, Paperfetcher automates hand-search and snowball-search.
To begin with, read our preprint (coming soon!).

Paperfetcher is free and open source, and is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/paperfetcher/paperfetcher/blob/master/LICENSE). If you wish to use paperfetcher for your research, all we ask is that you cite our preprint.

# Getting started with Paperfetcher

## I want a quick solution - no setup, no Python coding. | I'm okay with storing my data on Google Drive.

We have three Google Colab notebook apps for you! These are small apps/widgets that run inside your browser on Google Colab (a cloud computing platform by Google for running Python code), and require just a few mouse clicks to run. Read our preprint to learn more about each app! 

Click on the links below to open the apps in your browser.

1. [Hand-search version A](https://colab.research.google.com/github/paperfetcher/paperfetcher-colab-app/blob/main/paperfetcher_handsearch_DOI_app.ipynb): saves DOIs of search results only. Can directly import .txt output into Zotero.
2. [Hand-search version B](https://colab.research.google.com/github/paperfetcher/paperfetcher-colab-app/blob/main/paperfetcher_handsearch_citations_app.ipynb): saves multiple fields (from choices of DOI, URL, Title, Authors, and Publication Date) of search results.
3. [Snowball-search](https://colab.research.google.com/github/paperfetcher/paperfetcher-colab-app/blob/main/paperfetcher_snowballsearch_app.ipynb): saves DOIs of search results only. Can directly import .txt output into Zotero.

## I'm okay with setup, but no Python coding. | I want to store my data offline.

The setup process involves a couple of steps:
1. [Install Python]()

# The team
Paperfetcher was formulated by [Qiyang Zhang](qiyangzh.github.io) at the [Johns Hopkins University](jhu.edu) and developed by [Akash Pallath](apallath.github.io) at the [University of Pennsylvania](upenn.edu).
